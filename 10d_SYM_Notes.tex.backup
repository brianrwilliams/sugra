\section{Minimal Super Yang-Mills}
Our starting point will be the theory complexifying the usual 10d super Yang-Mills theory.  Fix a complex reductive gauge group $G$ with Lie algebra $\gg$.  The ordinary fields of super Yang-Mills theory on $\RR^{10}$ consist of a boson: a connection $A$ on the trivial $G$-bundle, and a fermion: a $\gg$-valued section $\lambda$ of the Weyl spinor bundle associated to the spinor representation $S_+$ \footnote{If we didn't complexify we would instead consider $G_\RR$ a compact connected Lie group, and a section of the Majorana-Weyl spinor bundle, which necessitates working in Lorentzian signature.}.  These fields are acted upon by the group of gauge transformations -- $G$-valued functions on $\RR^{10}$.

We can model the stack of fields modulo gauge transformations infinitesimally near the point $0$ by the corresponding BRST complex.  This is the local super Lie algebra
\[L_{\mr{BRST}} = \Omega^0(\RR^{10}; \gg) \to \Omega^1(\RR^{10}; \gg \oplus \Pi S_+ \otimes \gg)\]
placed in cohomological degrees 0 and 1, with bracket induced from the Lie bracket on $\gg$.
